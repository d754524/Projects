The python file where I wrote the code is called Project2.py

Open the command line and change the directory to the archive containing the python file.
Then, type Python Project2.py and let it run. The program will finish when the shortest path
from any node to all other nodes are found.

The network.txt file has a matrix of the form:

e.g.

0,2,0,0,1
2,0,5,0,0
0,5,0,4,0
0,0,4,0,1
1,0,0,1,0


or 

0,10,10,10,10
10,0,0,0,0
10,0,0,0,0
10,0,0,0,0
10,0,0,0,0
